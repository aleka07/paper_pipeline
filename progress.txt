# Progress Log - Paper Pipeline Web Interface

## Codebase Patterns
- Use existing `LocalPDFProcessor` class from `pdf_processor.py` for processing logic
- File status derived from existence: input PDF → markdown → JSON output
- Directory structure: `data/input/`, `data/markdown/`, `data/output/`
- Backend serves on `0.0.0.0:5000` for LAN accessibility
- Frontend is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS in `frontend/` directory

## 2026-01-16T13:08 - US-001: Flask Backend Setup
Conversation: 93b691cf-df30-4b46-a2b3-26177c03c39f
- Created `backend/app.py` with Flask application setup
- Configured CORS for local network access with `flask-cors`
- Application binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 for LAN accessibility
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- Created placeholder `frontend/index.html` for static file serving
- Installed flask and flask-cors dependencies
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`, `backend/__init__.py`, `frontend/index.html`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Flask serves static files from `../frontend` relative to app.py location
  - CORS configured with wildcard origins for local network development

## 2026-01-16T13:12 - US-002: Category API Endpoints
Conversation: 1e7d61c6-440c-4a66-badc-19ff6193408f
- Implemented Category CRUD endpoints in `backend/app.py`
- GET /api/categories returns list with file counts and status summary
- POST /api/categories creates new category folder (returns 201)
- DELETE /api/categories/<name> removes empty category (returns 404 if not found, 400 if not empty)
- Added helper functions: `get_file_status()` and `get_category_stats()`
- Directory paths use `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform compatibility
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - File status derived from: PDF exists → check for .json (completed) → check for .md (markdown) → pending
  - Category directories created in all three data folders: input/, markdown/, output/

## 2026-01-16T13:15 - US-003: File Upload API
Conversation: 95b92c1b-a772-4d47-a546-51c46d45c445
- Implemented POST /api/categories/<name>/upload endpoint
- PDF validation checks both file extension and MIME type
- Duplicate filenames handled by appending _1, _2, etc.
- File ID generated using MD5 hash of category/filename (12 chars)
- Uses werkzeug `secure_filename` for safe path handling
- Returns 201 on success with file info (id, filename, category, size, status)
- Returns 400 on validation errors, 404 on missing category
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `request.files['file']` to access uploaded files in Flask
  - `secure_filename()` from werkzeug prevents path traversal attacks
  - MIME type checking should be lenient (allow application/octet-stream as fallback)

## 2026-01-16T13:21 - US-004: File Listing API with Status
Conversation: 138c6557-f6cd-4b78-8062-67ad7de9afde
- Implemented GET /api/categories/<name>/files endpoint
- Returns list of files with: id, filename, category, status, size, upload_date
- Status derived from existence of .json (completed) or .md (markdown) files
- Returns 404 for non-existent categories
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use `datetime.fromtimestamp(stat.st_mtime).isoformat()` for file upload dates
  - Sorted glob results for consistent file ordering

## 2026-01-16T13:25 - US-005: Processing Trigger API
Conversation: c9140dcd-a9f3-4097-9139-e4aa1441d8b1
- Implemented background processing infrastructure with job tracking
- POST /api/process/file/<file_id> triggers full pipeline for single file
- POST /api/process/category/<name> triggers processing for all pending files in category
- POST /api/process/all triggers processing for all pending files across all categories
- Processing runs in background thread (non-blocking) using Queue
- Returns job ID for status tracking
- Integrates with LocalPDFProcessor for two-phase processing (PDF→MD→JSON)
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `threading.Thread(daemon=True)` for background processor that auto-exits with main
  - Use `Queue` from stdlib for thread-safe task queue
  - Lazy initialization of processor with global `_processor` variable
  - Status includes "markdown" for files that have phase 1 done but need phase 2

## 2026-01-16T13:33 - US-006: Processing Status API
Conversation: 7d1c1d9b-4a0d-4f13-a450-add5f4301d65
- Implemented GET /api/status endpoint in `backend/app.py`
- Returns current processing state: status (idle/running/paused), current_file, current_phase (1 or 2), queue_length
- Uses existing `processing_state` dictionary with locking for thread safety
- Pyright typecheck passes with 0 errors
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `processing_state` global dict already tracks all needed status info
  - Use `processing_lock` when reading shared state for thread safety
---

## 2026-01-16T13:36 - US-007: Processing Control API (Pause/Resume/Cancel)
Conversation: d72411ef-c34a-4ff0-b28c-4951196a9a3e
- Implemented POST /api/process/pause endpoint - pauses after current file completes
- Implemented POST /api/process/resume endpoint - resumes paused processing
- Implemented POST /api/process/cancel endpoint - stops processing and clears queue
- All endpoints properly update `processing_state` with thread-safe locking
- Pyright typecheck passes with 0 errors
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `processing_queue.get_nowait()` in a loop to drain queue for cancel
   - Cancel must reset all processing state fields (status, current_file, current_phase, queue_length)

## 2026-01-16T13:37 - US-008: Results API (JSON Output)
Conversation: 5d6eed17-c7ba-40c0-a753-cdb4cfdc773e
- Implemented GET /api/results/<file_id> endpoint - returns parsed JSON content
- Implemented GET /api/results/<file_id>/raw endpoint - returns raw JSON file as download
- Returns 404 with helpful error message if file not found or not yet processed
- Error responses include file status and processing suggestion
- Pyright typecheck passes with 0 errors
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Flask's `Response` class with `Content-Disposition` header for file downloads
  - json.load() for parsed content, raw file read for download endpoint
---

## 2026-01-16T13:40 - US-009: File Delete and Reprocess API
Conversation: 61a74357-aa9d-45d7-8a2e-16d58534493d
- Implemented DELETE /api/files/<file_id> endpoint - removes PDF and all associated outputs (md, json)
- Implemented POST /api/files/<file_id>/reprocess endpoint - clears outputs and queues for reprocessing
- Returns deleted/cleared file paths in response, with 207 Multi-Status if partial deletion
- Returns job_id for reprocess to track processing status
- Pyright typecheck passes with 0 errors
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `path.unlink()` for file deletion (pathlib method)
  - 207 Multi-Status is appropriate for partial success scenarios
  - Reprocess should clear both .md and .json before queuing to ensure full pipeline runs

## 2026-01-16T13:45 - US-010: Search and Filter API
Conversation: 9189dc4f-4703-43a5-b1c3-41dcd336b59f
- Implemented GET /api/search?q=<query> endpoint for full-text search across JSON results
- Searches title, authors, keywords, and summary/abstract fields (case-insensitive)
- Returns matching files with relevance snippets and match count
- Supports category filtering with ?category=<name> parameter
- Results sorted by relevance (match count descending)
- Pyright typecheck passes with 0 errors
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `dict.get()` with fallback fields for flexible data access (e.g., summary vs abstract)
  - Extract snippets with context for better search UX (±50 chars around match)
  - Sort results by match_count for relevance ranking

- Both endpoints support ?include_pdf=true to include original PDF files
- Created helper function `create_export_zip()` for in-memory zip creation
- Uses zipfile module with ZIP_DEFLATED compression
- Proper error handling returns 404 if no processed files to export
- Pyright typecheck passes with 0 errors
- Files changed: `backend/app.py`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use io.BytesIO for in-memory zip file creation
